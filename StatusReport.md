An update on each of the tasks described on your project plan including references to specific artifacts in your repository (such as datasets, scripts, workflows, workflow diagrams, etc).
An updated timeline indicating the status of each task and when they will be completed.
A description of any changes to your project plan itself, in particular about your progress so far. Also include changes you made to your plan based on feedback you may have received for Milestone 2.
Each team member has to write a short summary of their contributions to the current milestone. Each team member should add and commit their contribution summary themselves to the shared github repo.

Sankirtana Ravichandran:  I cleaned one dataset and developed a series of visualizations to help our group explore its contents in isolation. This was an interesting experience because I followed the same data-cleaning pattern I discussed with my teammates, including imputing missing values and standardizing naming conventions across the dataset. However, after completing that initial exploration of the data and cleaning it, I realized that there are other aspects of this data that may require further exploration. During the data cleaning phase of this project, we divided and conquered the tasks. However, I believe we will need to collaborate more closely in order to effectively integrate the three datasets together.
