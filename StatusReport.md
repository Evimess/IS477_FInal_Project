An update on each of the tasks described on your project plan including references to specific artifacts in your repository (such as datasets, scripts, workflows, workflow diagrams, etc).
An updated timeline indicating the status of each task and when they will be completed.
A description of any changes to your project plan itself, in particular about your progress so far. Also include changes you made to your plan based on feedback you may have received for Milestone 2.
Each team member has to write a short summary of their contributions to the current milestone. Each team member should add and commit their contribution summary themselves to the shared github repo.

## Individual Contributions:

Luke Gauer: I helped plan out the timeline for the rest of our project and made sure we hit the goals we previously missed from our last update. While cleaning the data, I made sure it was clear and accessible so that anyone who reads our project will be able to understand and digest the information easily. These steps ensure that we will be able to integrate the datasets efficiently in the coming weeks which will allow us to easily analyze using python. While we just started producing visualizations, I'm continuing to brainstorm more efficient ways to do this so that our project is as succinct and insightful as possible. Finally I created a google doc to present the steps on how to replicate our work so that it's transparent. This document will be updated in the following weeks with our new changes and will be complete before our final submission. 


Sankirtana Ravichandran:  I cleaned one dataset and developed a series of visualizations to help our group explore its contents in isolation. This was an interesting experience because I followed the same data-cleaning pattern I discussed with my teammates, including imputing missing values and standardizing naming conventions across the dataset. However, after completing that initial exploration of the data and cleaning it, I realized that there are other aspects of this data that may require further exploration. During the data cleaning phase of this project, we divided and conquered the tasks. However, I believe we will need to collaborate more closely in order to effectively integrate the three datasets together.
